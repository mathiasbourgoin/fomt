# Session notes

Local-only file. This repo (`fomt-decomp`, clone of `StanHash/fomt`) is
worked on strictly offline: `origin`'s push URL is deliberately broken
(`DISABLED-local-only-see-CLAUDE-md`) as a guardrail and must never be
restored. Never `git push`, never open a PR, never touch `origin`. Commit
locally only.

## 2026-08-20 -- toolchain bring-up + first matched function

### Build environment

- **arm-none-eabi toolchain**: already present on the machine but not on
  `PATH` -- binaries live under
  `/home/mathias/.local/opt/arm-gnu-toolchain-15.2.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/bin`.
  `as`, `strip`, `objdump`, `readelf`, `cpp` were missing symlinks in
  `~/.local/bin` (only `gcc`, `ld`, `objcopy`, `nm` were linked); fixed by
  symlinking the rest of the toolset from that opt dir into `~/.local/bin`.
- **agbcc/agbcp**: built from `notyourav/agbcc` (`cp` branch) via
  `tools/install_agbcp.sh`, but the stock script fails outright on this
  machine's host gcc (16.1.1, released 2026):
  - `LIBRARY_PATH` on this shell starts with a bare `:` (current-dir
    entry) which the ancient egcs `configure` refuses outright
    ("shouldn't contain the current directory") -- fixed by `unset
    LIBRARY_PATH` for the build.
  - GCC >=14 turns `-Wimplicit-int` into a hard *error* by default (was a
    warning historically); egcs-era sources rely on implicit-int
    K&R-style declarations throughout and fail to even pass `configure`'s
    "does the C compiler work" check. Fixed by building the whole agbcc/
    agbcp toolchain with `CC="gcc -std=gnu99 -fpermissive"` /
    `CXX="g++ -std=gnu++98 -fpermissive"` (plain `-std=gnu89` also
    silences the error but then chokes on C99-style `for (int i = ...)`
    declarations inside `real.h`, so gnu99+fpermissive is the one that
    gets through the whole tree).
  - `gcc_arm`/`g++_arm` (the ARM-hosted `agbcc_arm`/`agbcp_arm` binaries)
    were **not** built -- `fomt-decomp`'s `Makefile` never references
    them (only `agbcc`, `agbcp`, `old_agbcc`), so `install_agbcp.sh`'s
    later steps for those two were skipped entirely (built agbcc,
    old_agbcc, agbcp, libgcc.a, libc.a by hand, one `make` target at a
    time, then copied straight into `tools/agbcc/{bin,lib,include}`
    inside this repo, matching `install.sh`'s layout).
  - Result installed at `tools/agbcc/bin/{agbcc,old_agbcc,agbcp}` and
    `tools/agbcc/lib/{libgcc.a,libc.a}` -- all gitignored (`tools/.gitignore`
    already excludes `agbcc`), nothing of this got committed.
- **ROM**: `baserom.gba` found at
  `/home/mathias/dev/jeux-langues/harvest-moon-franglais/baserom.gba`
  (symlink to `build/baserom.gba` in that repo), SHA1
  `a2fc3574f0a65a4fcf7682fb274b9d7eebdef963` -- matches `fomt.sha1`
  exactly. Copied (not moved) into `fomt-decomp/baserom.gba`.
  `.gitignore` already has `*.gba`, confirmed `git status` shows nothing
  tracked for it.
- **Baseline `make compare`**: passes bit-exact from a clean checkout,
  **~5 seconds** wall clock for a full rebuild (`time make compare`:
  `real 0m5.011s`). This repo is still mostly `asm/`-only (a handful of
  `.cc`/`.c` files are decompiled so far), so the build is small and fast
  -- cheap enough to run `make compare` after every single-function edit
  rather than doing anything smarter (no need for object-level partial
  verification).

### Gotcha for future rounds: `objdump -bbinary` addressing

`asmdiff.sh` (checked into the repo) calls
`arm-none-eabi-objdump -D -bbinary -marmv4t -Mforce-thumb` **without**
`--adjust-vma=0x08000000`. With `-bbinary`, objdump treats address 0 as
the start of the file, so passing a real GBA address (`0x0805E6CC` etc.)
as `--start-address` silently produces **empty output** (out of range,
no error) -- this cost real time this session (false "no diff" readings
while debugging a mismatch). Always add `--adjust-vma=0x08000000`
manually when reproducing what `asmdiff.sh` does, or pass file offsets
(`address - 0x08000000`) if invoking it as documented.

### Splitting a function out of a monolithic `asm/*.s` file

`fomt.lds` places every object's `.text` explicitly, by filename, in
exact original-ROM order (`SECTIONS { .rom : { fileA.o(.text);
fileB.o(.text); ... } }`) -- addresses are **not** derived from link
order automatically, they come from this manually curated list. Several
early functions were already decompiled this way; most of the ROM is
still one or a few giant hand-numbered `asm/code_ADDRESS.s` files with
hundreds of functions concatenated in one `.text` blob (e.g.
`asm/code_0803EE94.s` was 179483 lines / cov213 KB+ of code before this
session, spanning at least `0x0803EE94`-`0x0809B0FC`).

To decompile one function living in the middle of such a blob:

1. Find its `thumb_func_start` line and the next function's, via
   `grep -n`.
2. `sed` the original file into two pieces: everything up to (not
   including) the target function's `thumb_func_start` line stays under
   the original filename; everything from the *next* function's
   `thumb_func_start` onward goes into a new file named after that next
   function's address (`asm/code_<NEXTADDR>.s`), with the same 2-line
   `.INCLUDE "asm/macro.inc"` / `.SYNTAX UNIFIED` header prepended.
3. Write the C/C++ port into `src/code_<ADDR>.cc` (or `.c`).
4. Insert **both** new object references into `fomt.lds` at the exact
   point where the old single entry was, in order:
   `asm/code_OLD.o(.text); src/code_ADDR.o(.text); asm/code_NEXT.o(.text);`
5. `rm -rf build fomt.gba fomt.elf fomt.map && make compare`.
6. If the linked ROM is the wrong total *size*, it means the C function
   didn't compile to the same byte count as the original asm -- compare
   `arm-none-eabi-readelf -S build/src/code_ADDR.o` `.text` size against
   `nextaddr - thisaddr` to confirm/quantify, then diff disassembly
   (`--adjust-vma=0x08000000`!) around the function to see which
   statement produced a different instruction count.
7. If the size matches but content doesn't: diff disassembly directly,
   the mismatch is almost always register-allocation / instruction
   scheduling from writing the C in a different **statement order** than
   whatever the original source had -- reorder local variable
   computations to mirror the read/compute/store order visible in the
   original asm as closely as possible, and iterate. `make compare` is
   cheap (~5s) so this is a fast loop.
8. Only commit once `sha1sum -c fomt.sha1` reports success. Revert (`git
   checkout -- <files>; rm <new files>`) and rebuild-verify a clean
   `make compare` pass before moving to the next attempt if it doesn't
   converge in a reasonable number of tries.

### Functions matched

- **`func_0805E6CC`** (`0x0805E6CC`), the `DefinedSprite` archive
  constructor -- see `docs/GRAPHISMES.md` /
  `docs/SPRITES_INVENTORY.md` in the franglais patch repo for the
  7-section archive format this confirms in code. Split out of
  `asm/code_0803EE94.s` into `src/code_0805E6CC.cc` (+ the tail of that
  file renamed `asm/code_0805E760.s`). Matched bit-exact after one
  iteration (had to write the last section's pointer store as
  `self->instr_data = data + 4;` rather than `data += 4; self->instr_data
  = data;` -- the latter reuses the same register for the dead `data`
  write-back and produces one fewer/differently-scheduled instruction
  than the original, which computes the last offset into a fresh
  register instead of updating the cursor in place since it's never read
  again).
  Commit: `648d15f` -- "decomp: match func_0805E6CC (DefinedSprite
  archive constructor)".

### Function attempted and reverted

- **`func_0805E790`** (`0x0805E790`), the paired "frame accessor" that
  resolves a `DefinedSprite` frame index into 4 (pointer, value) pairs
  (OAM/tiles/palette/matrix) -- see the same docs section. Split
  mechanically the same way (out of what had become `asm/code_0805E760.s`
  after the first split), C written and iterated twice:
  - First attempt: wrong by -12 bytes (missing content), used an
    over-abstracted intermediate struct cast that didn't match the
    original's flatter access pattern.
  - Second attempt: **sizes matched exactly** (8388608 bytes both sides)
    but disassembly still diverges on register allocation: the original
    only spills 2 values to high registers (`r8`, `r9`) across the
    straight-line block, while every C statement ordering I tried needed
    3 (`r8`, `r9`, `sl`/`r10`) -- meaning the original C source keeps one
    fewer value simultaneously live than any reordering I tried,
    something not fully recoverable just by re-reading the instruction
    order (this is exactly the "register pressure" class of decomp
    problem that's hardest to reverse without the original source: 8
    output fields, 8 low registers minus one reserved for the `self`
    pointer, so any statement order keeping 3 partial results alive at
    once loses).
  - **Reverted cleanly** (`git checkout -- fomt.lds
    asm/code_0805E760.s; rm src/code_0805E790.cc asm/code_0805E824.s`),
    confirmed `make compare` passes again before stopping. Nothing
    broken, no partial state left in the tree.
  - Struct layout notes worth keeping for whoever picks this back up:
    the 16-byte frame-metadata entry is `{ u16 oam_count, oam_index,
    unk_04, tile_index, unk_08, pal_index, matrix_count, matrix_index
    }`; `unk_04`/`unk_08` get left-shifted by 5 into the output rather
    than used as plain counts -- their real meaning is unconfirmed. The
    4 index fields resolve to pointers via `archive_field_base +
    index << {3,5,5,3}` for OAM/tiles/palette/matrix respectively,
    matching `docs/GRAPHISMES.md`'s "x8, x32, x32, x8" note.

### Scope note (why this session only landed one function)

A parallel session sent a message mid-task asking to broaden the target
list from the original 5 candidates to *every* well-established finding
across the whole franglais-patch reverse-engineering effort (VWF chain,
HUD, PALETTE, full ENGINE.md/DIALOGUE.md, etc. -- potentially dozens of
functions). That is real, valuable scope, but this session had already
sunk substantial time into getting agbcc/agbcp to build at all against a
2026-era host toolchain (see above), and the one function landed
(`func_0805E6CC`) took multiple iterations just on the disassembly-match
side, plus a second (`func_0805E790`) that didn't converge. Given that,
this round intentionally stopped after establishing the environment +
the split methodology + one clean match, rather than rushing several
more functions and risking a bad commit. See "Priority list for the next
round" below for where to pick up.

### Priority list for the next round

In rough order of expected effort-to-match, based on what's already
documented in `/home/mathias/dev/jeux-langues/harvest-moon-franglais/docs/`:

1. **`func_0805E790`** (`0x0805E790`) -- retry with fresh eyes on the
   register-pressure problem above; the archive/frame struct layouts are
   already fully solved, only the exact C statement order to hit 2
   spilled regs instead of 3 remains. Good candidate for a >1-iteration
   budget rather than a quick attempt.
2. **`franglais_transition_ctl_query`** / `0x08050DF0` -- `docs/CHARACTER_SELECT.md`
   round 7 has this one fully characterized dynamically.
3. **`Unpack`** at `0x080D102C` -- the LZSS+Huffman decoder,
   `docs/BACKGROUNDS_INVENTORY.md` has the full bitstream format decoded,
   and `tools/unpack_decoder.py` in the franglais patch repo is a
   bit-exact Python reference implementation to translate from. Larger
   function, more branches, likely more iteration to match than the
   straight-line ones above -- budget accordingly.
4. Script-callable native dispatch table `0x0803F900` --
   `docs/DIALOGUE.md` round 23. Table/dispatch-shaped code tends to
   match on the first or second try if the table entries themselves are
   already correctly typed asm data (check whether `asm/vtables.s` or a
   sibling data file already carries it before assuming it needs
   porting as code).
5. Screen/scene constructor table `0x080E59D4`-`0x080E8618` --
   `docs/ENGINE.md`, round `decomp-boot-callers`. Grep for these bounds
   in `asm/` first; did not check this session whether it's plain data
   (in which case it's a `.rodata`-relabelling job, much cheaper) or
   code.
6. Everything else flagged by the parallel-session message as
   "well-established" across `docs/VWF.md`, `docs/HUD.md`,
   `docs/PALETTE.md`, the rest of `docs/ENGINE.md`
   (FOMT-203/204/205/206/207), the rest of `docs/DIALOGUE.md` (24+
   rounds), `docs/SPRITES_INVENTORY.md`/`docs/GRAPHISMES.md` beyond the
   `DefinedSprite` pair, `docs/BACKGROUNDS_INVENTORY.md`,
   `docs/CLAIRE_SPRITE_PORTABILITY.md`, `docs/MFOMT_ADDITIONS.md`,
   `docs/LANGUAGE_LEVEL.md` -- none of this was scoped function-by-function
   this session (no addresses individually checked against `asm/` for
   whether they're even reachable as discrete symbols yet); a future
   round should start there with a pass that just lists candidate
   addresses + whether they already have a `thumb_func_start` symbol in
   `asm/`, before attempting any port, to build a real prioritized queue
   instead of guessing at effort.

### Repo state at end of session

- Working tree clean, `make compare` passes bit-exact.
- One new commit on top of `9636a71`: `648d15f` (func_0805E6CC).
- `origin` push URL untouched (`DISABLED-local-only-see-CLAUDE-md`),
  nothing pushed, no PR opened, no network action taken against origin.
